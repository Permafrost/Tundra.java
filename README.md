## Contributions

1. Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
   implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
2. Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
   requested it and/or contributed it.
3. Fork the project.
4. Start a feature/bugfix branch.
5. Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
6. Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so it won't
   break in a future version unintentionally.

Please try not to mess with the project version, or history. If you
want your own version please isolate it to its own commit, so it can
be cherry-picked around.
